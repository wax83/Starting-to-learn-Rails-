# Starting to learn Rails

I started to learn Ruby on Rails just recently.
I've been told that this book (http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails), could be a nice starting point.
I'm also following the instructions written by Michael Hartl in
his tutorial series [*Learn Rails by Example*] (http://ruby.railstutorial.org/).
